# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I have had experience working with iOS apps in the past, but never building one from scratch. For my first hack-a-thing, I set up an iOS application from scratch using Swift, CocoaPods, and external packages. This app has a login and registration flow that stores users in Firebase (both through normal email authentication and Facebook authentication) and utilizes a messaging package to make messages look nice. :smile:

## Screenshots

Here is a log in flow with email authentication!
