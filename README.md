# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I have had experience working with iOS apps in the past, but never building one from scratch. For my first hack-a-thing, I set up an iOS application from scratch using Swift, CocoaPods, and external packages. This app has a login and registration flow that stores users in Firebase (both through normal email authentication and Facebook authentication) and utilizes a messaging package to make messages look nice. :smile:

## Screenshots

Here is a log in flow with email authentication!

Here is a registration flow!

## Who Did What?

I worked on this myself. 
I also originally worked on this on this repo before porting it into the classroom repo. (Oops.) Here is a [link to my commit history]( https://github.com/maria-roodnitsky/messenger/tree/main)

## What you learned

I ran into multiple issues working on this. Swift has changed slightly, so some imports needed to be hacky.
